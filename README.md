Presentation on Call Center Performance Analysis
Slide 1: Introduction
Objective: To analyze the performance of different call centers and communication channels based on customer sentiment and SLA (Service Level Agreement) compliance.
Data Source: Analysis is based on historical data from call center interactions, including customer sentiment, CSAT scores, call duration, and SLA compliance.
Slide 2: Overview of Sentiment Distribution
Pivot Table 1: Sentiment by Call Center
Key Findings:
The Los Angeles/CA call center had the highest number of interactions but also recorded a significant number of Very Negative sentiments.
Baltimore/MD excelled in customer satisfaction, with more Very Positive sentiments compared to other centers.
Denver/CO displayed a balanced sentiment distribution, with fewer Very Negative and Negative sentiments.
Implications: The Los Angeles call center may need targeted improvements in customer handling and possibly additional training for agents to reduce negative feedback.
Slide 3: SLA Compliance Across Channels
Pivot Table 2: SLA Compliance by Channel
Key Findings:
The Chatbot channel had the highest number of Below SLA cases, particularly in handling billing-related inquiries, indicating potential issues with automated responses.
The Email and Web channels showed relatively better SLA compliance, with a majority of their interactions being Within SLA.
Call-Center interactions generally performed well regarding SLA, but there were isolated Above SLA cases that should be addressed.
Implications: Focus on improving the chatbot's response times and accuracy to enhance customer experience and ensure SLA compliance.
Slide 4: Sentiment vs. SLA Compliance
Pivot Table 3: Sentiment Across SLA Compliance
Key Findings:
Analysis revealed a strong correlation between Below SLA cases and Very Negative sentiment, especially in the Chatbot and Call-Center channels.
Above SLA cases also tended to generate more Negative sentiments, particularly in billing-related issues.
Implications: Improving SLA adherence could directly impact customer satisfaction, particularly in channels where automation is used. Consider integrating more human oversight or enhancing AI capabilities in these channels.
Slide 5: Performance by Reason for Contact
Pivot Table 4: Common Reasons and Their Impact
Key Findings:
Billing Questions were the most common reason for contact and were associated with a higher number of Negative and Very Negative sentiments, especially when SLAs were not met.
Payments inquiries yielded more Very Positive sentiments when handled within SLA, indicating effective processes in place for this category.
Service Outages were another frequent reason and often led to Neutral sentiments, suggesting that while issues were resolved, the experience wasn't necessarily positive.
Implications: Prioritize improvements in handling billing-related inquiries, focusing on quick resolution and clear communication to shift customer sentiment from negative to positive.
Slide 6: Call Duration and Channel Efficiency
Pivot Table 5: Average Call Duration by Channel
Key Findings:
The Web and Chatbot channels had the longest average call durations, indicating potential inefficiencies in automated handling or complex customer needs that can't be swiftly addressed through these channels.
Call-Center had a moderate average duration but was more effective in maintaining customer satisfaction compared to automated channels.
Implications: Consider streamlining processes in the Web and Chatbot channels, possibly by enhancing AI or providing quicker paths to human assistance for complex issues.
Slide 7: Recommendations
Targeted Improvements for Los Angeles Call Center: Implement additional training and support for agents, focusing on reducing negative sentiment.
Enhance AI Capabilities in Automated Channels: Improve SLA compliance and customer satisfaction by upgrading chatbot and web-based service handling.
Focus on Billing Inquiries: Given the high volume and associated negative sentiment, streamline billing-related processes and ensure quick, accurate resolutions.
Slide 8: Conclusion
Summary: The analysis highlights the need for targeted improvements in specific call centers and channels to enhance overall customer satisfaction and SLA compliance.
Next Steps: Implement the recommended actions and monitor progress through ongoing analysis to ensure continuous improvement.
